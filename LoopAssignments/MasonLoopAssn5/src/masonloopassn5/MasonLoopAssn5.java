The world population reached 7,571,689,185 in 2017 and is growing at some rate 
per year. Ask the user for the rate of growth and assuming that the population 
will continue to grow at the same rate, write a program that will determine in 
what year the worldâ€™s population will exceed 10 billion. Output a chart showing 
the population each year.
