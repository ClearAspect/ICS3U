Determine how many years it would take for a person to double their investment. 
Ask the user for a deposit amount and an interest rate. How long does it take 
for the investment to double? Assume the interest is compounded yearly. Be sure 
to format your output correctly. (Donâ€™t use the formula - use a while loop!)
