The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that you maintain your training
heart rate during an aerobic workout.  Your training heart rate is computed as
0.7 x (220 - a ) + 0.3 x r  
where a is your age and r is your resting heart rate (your pulse when you first 
awaken). Write a program to request a personâ€™s age and resting heart rate and 
then calculate the training heart rate.
