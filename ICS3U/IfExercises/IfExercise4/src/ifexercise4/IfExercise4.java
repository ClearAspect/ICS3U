Write a program that calculates the userâ€™s Environmental Impact Index. Ask the user to enter the 
number of electronic devices in their household and the average age of the devices. The EII can be 
found by first dividing the number of devices by the average age of each device, and then multiplying 
by 10. Tell the user if their environmental impact is minimal (<5), average (5 to less than 15), high 
(15 to less than 30), or excessive (30+). Also output a helpful message to the user.*
